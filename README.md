# hello-world
I have only a vague idea what I'm doing.

## In which we try to document the use of some cool features in GIMP, Inkscape, etc.
I'm fascinated by all the available functions of GIMP and the possibilities they offer.
Lately I've been getting into using them in some pretty complicated ways, though.
In order to keep myself from getting lost or doing the same work over and over, it seems like a good idea to figure out some "best practices" and record them for future use (and future tweaking as my understanding increases).
